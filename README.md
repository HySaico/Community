## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/HySaico/Community) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We are hoping to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/HySaico/Community/discussions/1) if you want some guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.
